## Presentations
We had our final week of presentations and our last class this week. It was great to see everyone's presentations and the progress they made over the course of the semester. The final presentation was helpful in seeing our achievements and challenges put into words. Despite most of us chossing different projects, we all seemed to face similar issues in the end, whether it be initial communication issues or trouble setting up a development environment. 

## Final Reflection
I really enjoyed this class as it was different from other computer science electives I have taken in the past. I like how it was so interactive and we were able to choose what open source project we wanted to work on. There was a sort of unpredictability surrounding each project we chose, as none of us have contributed to it before, but it made the class and work we did feel more genuine. The contributions I made were small and took me a while to figure out, but it was worth it when they merged my pull request and interacted with me.
