title: "Week 9: Reflecting on Group Work"

Reflect on your group's work, progress you made challenges you faced, surprises you encountered

This week, our group met up to work on Appsmith. Our goal was to set up our development environment and focus on an issue to work on. We have attempted to ask the maintainers to be assigned to issues. I have also joined their discord and it seemed really friendly. 

A challenge I faced was setting up my development environment. I was familiar with some of the technologies that Appsmith used, like React, and I had heard of some other ones like Docker for databases. However, there were some technologies that were completely new to me. The set up instructions were very comprehensive and long, but I encountered some errors along the way that I was unsure how to resolve. 

I was surprised to see how many errors and blockers can come from just setting up the development environment. I expected it to be a fairly straightforward task where I just follow their instructions. but all of our machines are slightly different so different problems arise and it can be difficult to figure out how to fix those issues. However, we did recently get approved for an issue, so once we are able to resolve all of our own problems, we can get to work.
